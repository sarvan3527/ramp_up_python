#      2nd TASK  ==============

# Email Validation Program

This is a simple Python program that validates and manages email addresses. It allows users to enter email addresses, validates them using regular expressions, and stores valid email addresses in a text file.

The regular expression used for email validation in this program is a simplified  using a regular expression pattern.

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2.Import modules what ever is required

## Instructions

3. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: 


4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
    ** https://github.com/sarvan3527/ramp_up_python.git**

5. Run the program by executing the following command:


6. The program will prompt you with the question "Do you want to enter an email address? (Yes/No) :" Enter your choice ("Yes" or "No").

- If you choose "No," the program will read and display the contents of the "email_txt.txt" file, which contains the list of valid email addresses.

- If you choose "Yes," the program will prompt you to enter an email address. It will then validate the email using regular expressions. If the email is valid, it will be added to the "email_txt.txt" file, and the updated list of valid email addresses will be displayed.

7. You can continue entering email addresses or exit the program by typing "No."

8. To view the list of valid email addresses stored in the "email_txt.txt" file, run the program and choose "No" when prompted.




#    3rd  TASK  ================================

  # IP Address Validation and Ping Program

This is a Python program that validates and checks the reachability of IP addresses. It allows users to enter IP addresses, validates them using regular expressions, and performs a ping operation to check if the IP is reachable.

The regular expression used for IP address validation in this program using regular pattern.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the `ping3` library if you haven't already by running the following command:

## Instructions
3. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
    ** https://github.com/sarvan3527/ramp_up_python.git**

5. Run the program by executing the following command:


6. The program will prompt you with the question "Do you want to enter an ip address? (Yes/No) :" Enter your choice ("Yes" or "No").

- If you choose "No," the program will read and display the contents of the "ip_address.txt" file, which contains the results of IP address validations and ping tests.

- If you choose "Yes," the program will prompt you to enter an IP address. It will validate the IP using regular expressions. If the IP is valid, it will perform a ping operation to check its reachability. The validation and ping results will be saved in the "ip_address.txt" file.

7. You can continue entering IP addresses or exit the program by typing "No."

8. To view the results of IP address validations and ping tests stored in the "ip_address.txt" file, run the program and choose "No" when prompted.


#         4th Task      ==================

# Employee Details Generator with Threading

This Python program demonstrates the use of generators and threading to generate employee details concurrently. It generates random employee details including employee ID, location, and salary.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

4. Enter the desired number of employee details to generate.

5. The program will generate and display employee details concurrently using threading.

## Functionality

1. The `generate_employee_details` function generates employee details using a generator.
2. The generator yields employee ID, location, and salary for the specified number of employees.
3. Random values are chosen for each employee detail using the `random` module.
4. Threading is used to concurrently generate and display employee details.

5th Task

# Multiple Producers and Consumers using Threads

This Python program demonstrates the usage of multiple producers and consumers using threads. The program allows you to specify the number of producers and consumers, and it simulates their interactions through thread execution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the number of producers and consumers.

## Example

1. Enter the number of producers you want to perform.
2. Enter the number of consumers you want to perform.

The program will then simulate producers and consumers interactions using threads and display the output accordingly.

# Shape Area Calculator

This Python program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts using inheritance and function overriding. It calculates the areas of different geometric shapes: square, triangle, and circle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

4. The program will calculate and display the area of a square, a triangle, and a circle based on the provided dimensions.

## Shapes and Their Areas

### Square

- To calculate the area of a square, provide the side length.
- Formula: area = side_length^2

### Triangle

- To calculate the area of a triangle, provide the base and height.
- Formula: area = 0.5 * base * height

### Circle

- To calculate the area of a circle, provide the radius.
- Formula: area = pi * radius^2
